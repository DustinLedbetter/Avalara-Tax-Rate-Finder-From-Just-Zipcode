# Avalara-Tax-Rate-Finder-From-Just-Zipcode

--Project: Avalara Tax Rates Finder Web Version
<br>
--Start Date: 1-15-2019
<br>
--Purpose: To create a web application to display a tax rate for a user supplied zip code

----------------------------
Technologies Used:
----------------------------
 Visual Studio web service application, ASP.NET, Avalara Tax Client 2018-2019 (Including the use of their REST API's), JSON, ColdFusion 

------------------
Description:
------------------
I was asked to setup a web application that would display the tax rate of an area when a user supplied a zip code only. The code for this project would then be utilized with ColdFusion to replace another web application that was being used by the previous tax process I replaced. I have since completing this also added in extra functionality for the future including checking to see if the area code is US or Canada and displaying the results correctly for each.

-----------------------
What I learned:
-----------------------
-I learned more on Avalara and how it returns its API calls using JSON
<br>
-I learned a good bit of information on how the ColdFusion side is setup and how the code works with it.
<br>
-I learned how U.S. and Canada taxes differ

----------------------------------
Complications or Issues:
----------------------------------
--Complication: The only issue I ran into was figuring out how an Avalara API call is returned.
<br>
--Solution: Once I found it was JSON, I simply setup a way to get the information I needed from the file
